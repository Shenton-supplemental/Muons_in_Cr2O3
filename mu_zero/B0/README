Note that, because the extra electron is delocalised in this state (we actually have no gap!), the tetrahedron method is not expected to give accurate forces. 

The structure is therefore relaxed using Gaussian smearing, and then a two independant self-consistent calculations are performed, one with Gaussian smearing (to confirm the low-forces) and one with the tetrahedron method to get an accurate total energy. The output files are labelled as such.
